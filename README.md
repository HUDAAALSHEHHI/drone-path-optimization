# Drone Path Optimization

This repository demonstrates a practical project on **optimizing the path of a drone** to minimize energy consumption while avoiding obstacles, using gradient-based optimization techniques.

## 🔗 Quick Access
Open the project directly in Google Colab:

[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HUDAAALSHEHHI/drone-path-optimization/blob/main/drone_path_optimization.ipynb)

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab using the link above.
2. Run the cells in sequence (`Shift + Enter`) to:
   - Install required packages
   - Initialize the path and obstacles
   - Perform optimization using gradient-based methods
   - Visualize and save results
3. View the optimized drone path and generated plots in Colab or download them.

## 📂 Files in the Repository
- `drone_path_optimization.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the full implementation.
- `optimized_path.npy` – Saved optimized path (generated after running the notebook).
- `outputs_path_before_after.png` – Visualization of initial vs. optimized path.
- `outputs_objective_curve.png` – Optimization progress curve.

## 📖 Notes
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection while running the notebook in Colab.
- You can clone or fork the repository if you prefer running it locally.
